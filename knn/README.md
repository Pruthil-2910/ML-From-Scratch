## 🧭 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This folder contains an implementation of **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** from scratch using Python and NumPy.  

- 📌 **Concept**: KNN is a simple yet powerful non-parametric algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority vote of its *k* nearest neighbors.  
- 🔍 **Features**:  
  - only supports classification 
  - Uses **Euclidean distance** for similarity measurement.  
  - Easy to understand and visualize, making it great for beginners.  

👉 This serves as a foundation for experimenting with distance metrics, scaling, and optimizing K value for better accuracy.

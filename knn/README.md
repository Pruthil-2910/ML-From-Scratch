## 🧭 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This folder contains implementations of **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** from scratch using Python and NumPy.  

- 📌 **Concept**: KNN is a non-parametric algorithm that makes predictions based on the *k* closest data points in the feature space.  

- 🔍 **Variants**:  
  - **KNN Classifier** → Classifies a data point based on the majority vote of its neighbors.  
  - **KNN Regressor** → Predicts the target as the average of the neighbors’ values.  

- ⚡ **Features**:  
  - Supports both **classification** and **regression**.  
  - Uses **Euclidean distance** for similarity measurement.  
  - Easy to understand and extend, making it ideal for beginners.  

👉 A simple yet powerful algorithm that forms the foundation for many advanced ML techniques.
